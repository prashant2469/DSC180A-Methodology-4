1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

The most interesting topic this quarter was learning about how optimization algorithms like SGD and Adam differ in practice. It was fascinating to see how adaptive methods can speed up convergence but sometimes overfit, while simpler methods like SGD can perform better in the long run when tuned properly.

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

For the next quarter, I would like to explore how different optimizers behave under heavy-tailed gradient noise and varying batch sizes. I’m interested in seeing whether combining elements of SGD and Adam can improve both stability and generalization on real-world datasets.

3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

I would focus more on reproducibility and experimentation. In Quarter 1, our experiments were somewhat manual. For Quarter 2, I’d like to automate the process with better tracking of results and parameters, so that it’s easier to compare runs and analyze trends.

4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I’d like to try Bayesian optimization for tuning hyperparameters and possibly add some visualization of optimizer trajectories to better understand how they move through the loss landscape. It would also be interesting to study theoretical connections between optimizer behavior and generalization performance.
